# Linkist

## To Install

In Atom, Edit >> Preferences >> Install , search for `linkist` and click `Install`.

## To Use

Push **Ctrl+Alt+L** to insert a new "link tag" at the cursor. It looks like this `^4xy^` and renders in markdown like this: ^4xy^.

To visit other locations in the project with the same tag, put your cursor on a tag and enter **Ctrl+Alt+L**. (Currently this takes you to find-in-project but in the future will have more functionality.)
