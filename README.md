# Linkist

Creates tags that connect documents, even if you move them around.

## Get it

1. Open [Atom](https://atom.io/).
2. Type `Ctrl+,` and click `Install`.
4. Type `linkist` and install.

## Use it

1. To create a tag, type `Ctrl+Alt+L` and a tag like `^AaM^` will appear.
2. Go to another location and type `Ctrl+Alt+I` to insert another copy of that tag.
3. Put your cursor on any tag and type `Ctrl+Alt+L` to cycle through other places with that tag.

## And more...

* You can use this to implement a "Slip-box" note taking system. See [How to Take Smart Notes by SÃ¶nke Ahrens](https://amzn.to/2vi6Sm9) and https://zettelkasten.de for more resources and discussion.
* The `^tag^` format is rendered in markdown as a ^superscript^, which looks like a footnote.
* By default `*.md` and `*.txt` files are searched. You can change this in Settings.
* Unlinked tags will flash when you activate one with `Ctrl+Alt+L`.
