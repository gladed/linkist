# Linkist

A [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gladed.linkist) that creates persistent links between markdown documents in your workspace.

## Install

1. Open [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium).
2. Type `Ctrl+P` then paste in: `ext install gladed.linkist`

## Usage

1. Put your cursor on a markdown heading ...

    ```md
    # Horses
    ```

    ...and type `Ctrl+Alt+L`:

    ```md
    # [Horses](^2FnK^)
    ```
2. Copy that link anywhere else in your workspace, changing the text if you like:

    ```md
    ## Zebras

    Zebras are like [horses](^2FnK^), but with stripes.
    ```

3. Put your cursor on that link and type `Ctrl+Alt+L` again to go back to the heading.
4. Type `Ctrl+Alt+L` yet again to see all other places the link ID appears.
